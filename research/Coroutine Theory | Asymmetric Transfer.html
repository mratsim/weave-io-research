    <p>This is the first of a series of posts on the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4680.pdf">C++ Coroutines TS</a>, a new
language feature that is currently on track for inclusion into the
C++20 language standard.</p>

<p>In this series I will cover how the underlying mechanics of C++ Coroutines
work as well as show how they can be used to build useful higher-level abstractions
such as those provided by the <a href="https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro">cppcoro</a>
library.</p>

<p>In this post I will describe the differences between functions and coroutines
and provide a bit of theory about the operations they support. The aim of this post
is introduce some foundational concepts that will help frame the way you think about
C++ Coroutines.</p>

<h2 id="coroutines-are-functions-are-coroutines">Coroutines are Functions are Coroutines</h2>

<p>A coroutine is a generalisation of a function that allows the function to
be suspended and then later resumed.</p>

<p>I will explain what this means in a bit more detail, but before I do I want
to first review how a “normal” C++ function works.</p>

<h2 id="normal-functions">“Normal” Functions</h2>

<p>A normal function can be thought of as having two operations: <strong>Call</strong> and <strong>Return</strong>
(Note that I’m lumping “throwing an exception” here broadly under the <strong>Return</strong> operation).</p>

<p>The <strong>Call</strong> operation creates an activation frame, suspends execution of the calling
function and transfers execution to the start of the function being called.</p>

<p>The <strong>Return</strong> operation passes the return-value to the caller, destroys the activation frame
and then resumes execution of the caller just after the point at which it called the function.</p>

<p>Let’s analyse these semantics a little more…</p>

<h3 id="activation-frames">Activation Frames</h3>

<p>So what is this ‘activation frame’ thing?</p>

<p>You can think of the activation frame as the block of memory that holds the current state
of a particular invocation of a function. This state includes the values of any parameters
that were passed to it and the values of any local variables.</p>

<p>For “normal” functions, the activation frame also includes the return-address - the address
of the instruction to transfer execution to upon returning from the function - and the
address of the activation frame for the invocation of the calling function. You can think
of these pieces of information together as describing the ‘continuation’ of the function-call.
ie. they describe which invocation of which function should continue executing at which point
when this function completes.</p>

<p>With “normal” functions, all activation frames have strictly nested lifetimes.
This strict nesting allows use of a highly efficient memory allocation data-structure
for allocating and freeing the activation frames for each of the function calls.
This data-structure is commonly referred to as “the stack”.</p>

<p>When an activation frame is allocated on this stack data structure it is often
called a “stack frame”.</p>

<p>This stack data-structure is so common that most (all?) CPU architectures have a dedicated
register for holding a pointer to the top of the stack (eg. in X64 it is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rsp</code> register).</p>

<p>To allocate space for a new activation frame, you just increment this register by the frame-size.
To free space for an activation frame, you just decrement this register by the frame-size.</p>

<h3 id="the-call-operation">The ‘Call’ Operation</h3>

<p>When a function calls another function, the caller must first prepare itself for suspension.</p>

<p>This ‘suspend’ step typically involves saving to memory any values that are currently held in
CPU registers so that those values can later be restored if required when the function
resumes execution. Depending on the calling convention of the function, the caller
and callee may coordinate on who saves these register values, but you can still think
of them as being performed as part of the <strong>Call</strong> operation.</p>

<p>The caller also stores the values of any parameters passed to the called function
into the new activation frame where they can be accessed by the function.</p>

<p>Finally, the caller writes the address of the resumption-point of the caller to
the new activation frame and transfers execution to the start of the called function.</p>

<p>In the X86/X64 architecture this final operation has its own instruction, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call</code>
instruction, that writes the address of the next instruction onto the stack,
increments the stack register by the size of the address and then jumps to the
address specified in the instruction’s operand.</p>

<h3 id="the-return-operation">The ‘Return’ Operation</h3>

<p>When a function returns via a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code>-statement, the function first stores the return
value (if any) where the caller can access it. This could either be in the caller’s
activation frame or the function’s activation frame (the distinction can get a bit blurry
for parameters and return values that cross the boundary between two activation frames).</p>

<p>Then the function destroys the activation frame by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Destroying any local variables in-scope at the return-point.</li>
  <li>Destroying any parameter objects</li>
  <li>Freeing memory used by the activation-frame</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, it resumes execution of the caller by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Restoring the activation frame of the caller by setting the stack register
to point to the activation frame of the caller and restoring any registers
that might have been clobbered by the function.</li>
  <li>Jumping to the resume-point of the caller that was stored during the
‘Call’ operation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that as with the ‘Call’ operation, some calling conventions may split
the repsonsibilities of the ‘Return’ operation across both the caller and
callee function’s instructions.</p>

<h2 id="coroutines">Coroutines</h2>

<p>Coroutines generalise the operations of a function by separating out some of the
steps performed in the <strong>Call</strong> and <strong>Return</strong> operations into three extra operations:
<strong>Suspend</strong>, <strong>Resume</strong> and <strong>Destroy</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Suspend</strong> operation suspends execution of the coroutine at the current point within the
function and transfers execution back to the caller or resumer without destroying the
activation frame. Any objects in-scope at the point of suspension remain alive after the
coroutine execution is suspended.</p>

<p>Note that, like the <strong>Return</strong> operation of a function, a coroutine can only be suspended
from within the coroutine itself at well-defined suspend-points.</p>

<p>The <strong>Resume</strong> operation resumes execution of a suspended coroutine at the point at which
it was suspended. This reactivates the coroutine’s activation frame.</p>

<p>The <strong>Destroy</strong> operation destroys the activation frame without resuming execution of the
coroutine. Any objects that were in-scope at the suspend point will be destroyed. Memory
used to store the activation frame is freed.</p>

<h3 id="coroutine-activation-frames">Coroutine activation frames</h3>

<p>Since coroutines can be suspended without destroying the activation frame, we can no
longer guarantee that activation frame lifetimes will be strictly nested. This
means that activation frames cannot in general be allocated using a stack data-structure
and so may need to be stored on the heap instead.</p>

<p>There are some provisions in the C++ Coroutines TS to allow the memory for the
coroutine frame to be allocated from the activation frame of the caller if the compiler
can prove that the lifetime of the coroutine is indeed strictly nested within the
lifetime of the caller. This can avoid heap allocations in many cases provided you have
a sufficiently smart compiler.</p>

<p>With coroutines there are some parts of the activation frame that need to be preserved
across coroutine suspension and there are some parts that only need to be kept around
while the coroutine is executing. For example, the lifetime of a variable with a scope
that does not span any coroutine suspend-points can potentially be stored on the stack.</p>

<p>You can logically think of the activation frame of a coroutine as being comprised
of two parts: the ‘coroutine frame’ and the ‘stack frame’.</p>

<p>The ‘coroutine frame’ holds part of the coroutine’s activation frame that persists
while the coroutine is suspended and the ‘stack frame’ part only exists while the
coroutine is executing and is freed when the coroutine suspends and transfers
execution back to the caller/resumer.</p>

<h3 id="the-suspend-operation">The ‘Suspend’ operation</h3>

<p>The <strong>Suspend</strong> operation of a coroutine allows the coroutine to suspend execution
in the middle of the function and transfer execution back to the caller or resumer
of the coroutine.</p>

<p>There are certain points within the body of a coroutine that are designated as
suspend-points. In the C++ Coroutines TS, these suspend-points are identified
by usages of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">co_await</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">co_yield</code> keywords.</p>

<p>When a coroutine hits one of these suspend-points it first prepares the coroutine for
resumption by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring any values held in registers are written to the coroutine frame</li>
  <li>Writing a value to the coroutine frame that indicates which suspend-point the
coroutine is being suspended at. This allows a subsequent <strong>Resume</strong> operation
to know where to resume execution of the coroutine or so a subsequent <strong>Destroy</strong>
to know what values were in-scope and need to be destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the coroutine has been prepared for resumption, the coroutine is considered ‘suspended’.</p>

<p>The coroutine then has the opportunity to execute some additional logic before execution is
transferred back to the caller/resumer. This additional logic is given access to a handle
to the coroutine-frame that can be used to later resume or destroy it.</p>

<p>This ability to execute logic after the coroutine enters the ‘suspended’ state allows the
coroutine to be scheduled for resumption without the need for synchronisation that would
otherwise be required if the coroutine was scheduled for resumption prior to entering the
‘suspended’ state due to the potential for suspension and resumption of the coroutine to race.
I’ll go into this in more detail in future posts.</p>

<p>The coroutine can then choose to either immediately resume/continue execution of the
coroutine or can choose to transfer execution back to the caller/resumer.</p>

<p>If execution is transferred to the caller/resumer the stack-frame part of the coroutine’s
activation frame is freed and popped off the stack.</p>

<h3 id="the-resume-operation">The ‘Resume’ operation</h3>

<p>The <strong>Resume</strong> operation can be performed on a coroutine that is currently in the
‘suspended’ state.</p>

<p>When a function wants to resume a coroutine it needs to effectively ‘call’ into
the middle of a particular invocation of the function. The way the resumer identifies
the particular invocation to resume is by calling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">void resume()</code> method on the
coroutine-frame handle provided to the corresponding <strong>Suspend</strong> operation.</p>

<p>Just like a normal function call, this call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resume()</code> will allocate a new
stack-frame and store the return-address of the caller in the stack-frame before
transferring execution to the function.</p>

<p>However, instead of transferring execution to the start of the function it will
transfer execution to the point in the function at which it was last suspended.
It does this by loading the resume-point from the coroutine-frame and jumping
to that point.</p>

<p>When the coroutine next suspends or runs to completion this call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resume()</code>
will return and resume execution of the calling function.</p>

<h3 id="the-destroy-operation">The ‘Destroy’ operation</h3>

<p>The <strong>Destroy</strong> operation destroys the coroutine frame without resuming
execution of the coroutine.</p>

<p>This operation can only be performed on a suspended coroutine.</p>

<p>The <strong>Destroy</strong> operation acts much like the <strong>Resume</strong> operation in that
it re-activates the coroutine’s activation frame, including allocating a
new stack-frame and storing the return-address of the caller of the
<strong>Destroy</strong> operation.</p>

<p>However, instead of transferring execution to the coroutine body at the
last suspend-point it instead transfers execution to an alternative code-path
that calls the destructors of all local variables in-scope at the suspend-point
before then freeing the memory used by the coroutine frame.</p>

<p>Similar to the <strong>Resume</strong> operation, the <strong>Destroy</strong> operation identifies the
particular activation-frame to destroy by calling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">void destroy()</code> method
on the coroutine-frame handle provided during the corresponding <strong>Suspend</strong>
operation.</p>

<h3 id="the-call-operation-of-a-coroutine">The ‘Call’ operation of a coroutine</h3>

<p>The <strong>Call</strong> operation of a coroutine is much the same as the call operation of a
normal function. In fact, from the perspective of the caller there is no difference.</p>

<p>However, rather than execution only returning to the caller when the function
has run to completion, with a coroutine the call operation will instead resume
execution of the caller when the coroutine reaches its first suspend-point.</p>

<p>When performing the <strong>Call</strong> operation on a coroutine, the caller allocates a
new stack-frame, writes the parameters to the stack-frame, writes the return-address
to the stack-frame and transfers execution to the coroutine. This is exactly the
same as calling a normal function.</p>

<p>The first thing the coroutine does is then allocate a coroutine-frame on the heap
and copy/move the parameters from the stack-frame into the coroutine-frame so
that the lifetime of the parameters extends beyond the first suspend-point.</p>

<h3 id="the-return-operation-of-a-coroutine">The ‘Return’ operation of a coroutine</h3>

<p>The <strong>Return</strong> operation of a coroutine is a little different from that of a normal
function.</p>

<p>When a coroutine executes a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code>-statement (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">co_return</code> according to the TS)
operation it stores the return-value somewhere (exactly where this is stored can
be customised by the coroutine) and then destructs any in-scope local variables
(but not parameters).</p>

<p>The coroutine then has the opportunity to execute some additional logic before
transferring execution back to the caller/resumer.</p>

<p>This additional logic might perform some operation to publish the return value,
or it might resume another coroutine that was waiting for the result. It’s
completely customisable.</p>

<p>The coroutine then performs either a <strong>Suspend</strong> operation (keeping the
coroutine-frame alive) or a <strong>Destroy</strong> operation (destroying the coroutine-frame).</p>

<p>Execution is then transferred back to the caller/resumer as per the <strong>Suspend</strong>/<strong>Destroy</strong>
operation semantics, popping the stack-frame component of the activation-frame
off the stack.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the return-value passed to the <strong>Return</strong> operation is
not the same as the return-value returned from a <strong>Call</strong> operation as the return
operation may be executed long after the caller resumed from the initial <strong>Call</strong>
operation.</p>

<h2 id="an-illustration">An illustration</h2>

<p>To help put these concepts into pictures, I want to walk through a simple
example of what happens when a coroutine is called, suspends and is later
resumed.</p>

<p>So let’s say we have a function (or coroutine), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f()</code> that calls a coroutine, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x(int a)</code>.</p>

<p>Before the call we have a situation that looks a bit like this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>STACK                     REGISTERS               HEAP

                          +------+
+---------------+ &lt;------ | rsp  |
|  f()          |         +------+
+---------------+
| ...           |
|               |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x(42)</code> is called, it first creates a stack frame for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x()</code>, as with normal functions.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>STACK                     REGISTERS               HEAP
+----------------+ &lt;-+
|  x()           |   |
| a  = 42        |   |
| ret= f()+0x123 |   |    +------+
+----------------+   +--- | rsp  |
|  f()           |        +------+
+----------------+
| ...            |
|                |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, once the coroutine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x()</code> has allocated memory for the coroutine frame on the heap
and copied/moved parameter values into the coroutine frame we’ll end up with something
that looks like the next diagram. Note that the compiler will typically hold the address
of the coroutine frame in a separate register to the stack pointer (eg. MSVC stores this
in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rbp</code> register).</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>STACK                     REGISTERS               HEAP
+----------------+ &lt;-+
|  x()           |   |
| a  = 42        |   |                   +--&gt;  +-----------+
| ret= f()+0x123 |   |    +------+       |     |  x()      |
+----------------+   +--- | rsp  |       |     | a =  42   |
|  f()           |        +------+       |     +-----------+
+----------------+        | rbp  | ------+
| ...            |        +------+
|                |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the coroutine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x()</code> then calls another normal function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g()</code> it will look something like
this.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>STACK                     REGISTERS               HEAP
+----------------+ &lt;-+
|  g()           |   |
| ret= x()+0x45  |   |
+----------------+   |
|  x()           |   |
| coroframe      | --|-------------------+
| a  = 42        |   |                   +--&gt;  +-----------+
| ret= f()+0x123 |   |    +------+             |  x()      |
+----------------+   +--- | rsp  |             | a =  42   |
|  f()           |        +------+             +-----------+
+----------------+        | rbp  |
| ...            |        +------+
|                |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g()</code> returns it will destroy its activation frame and restore <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x()</code>’s activation frame.
Let’s say we save <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g()</code>’s return value in a local variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> which is stored in the coroutine
frame.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>STACK                     REGISTERS               HEAP
+----------------+ &lt;-+
|  x()           |   |
| a  = 42        |   |                   +--&gt;  +-----------+
| ret= f()+0x123 |   |    +------+       |     |  x()      |
+----------------+   +--- | rsp  |       |     | a =  42   |
|  f()           |        +------+       |     | b = 789   |
+----------------+        | rbp  | ------+     +-----------+
| ...            |        +------+
|                |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x()</code> now hits a suspend-point and suspends execution without destroying its
activation frame then execution returns to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f()</code>.</p>

<p>This results in the stack-frame part of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x()</code> being popped off the stack while
leaving the coroutine-frame on the heap. When the coroutine suspends for the
first time, a return-value is returned to the caller. This return value often
holds a handle to the coroutine-frame that suspended that can be used to later
resume it.
When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x()</code> suspends it also stores the address of the resumption-point of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x()</code>
in the coroutine frame (call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RP</code> for resume-point).</p>

<p>This handle may now be passed around as a normal value between functions.
At some point later, potentially from a different call-stack or even on a different
thread, something (say, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h()</code>) will decide to resume execution of that coroutine.
For example, when an async I/O operation completes.</p>

<p>The function that resumes the coroutine calls a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">void resume(handle)</code> function
to resume execution of the coroutine. To the caller, this looks just like any other
normal call to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">void</code>-returning function with a single argument.</p>

<p>This creates a new stack-frame that records the return-address of the caller to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resume()</code>, activates the coroutine-frame by loading its address into a register
and resumes execution of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x()</code> at the resume-point stored in the coroutine-frame.</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>I have described coroutines as being a generalisation of a function that has
three additional operations - ‘Suspend’, ‘Resume’ and ‘Destroy’ - in addition
to the ‘Call’ and ‘Return’ operations provided by “normal” functions.</p>

<p>I hope that this provides some useful mental framing for how to think of
coroutines and their control-flow.</p>

<p>In the next post I will go through the mechanics of the C++ Coroutines TS
language extensions and explain how the compiler translates code that you
write into coroutines.</p>
