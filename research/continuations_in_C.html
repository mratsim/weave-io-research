<h1>Continuations in C</h1>
The language scheme has an interesting feature: the
<tt>call/cc</tt> <a href="#4">[4]</a>
 function, otherwise
known as <em>call with current continuation</em>.
<p>
A continuation is essentially the state of a process at any moment in time. At
any point during execution you can think of it as an extra hidden argument that's
always implicitly referred to in your code. We take it for granted that the current
state of an executing system is available for our use and so we usually aren't
aware it's there at all.
<p>
<tt>call/cc</tt> makes it explicit. The current
state of execution can be grabbed and wrapped up as a first class object and
it can be reused elsewhere. It's great for implementing things like coroutines
where, in effect, you want to flip back and forth between different continuations.
<p>
If you read about continuations and it's sometimes pointed out that there is a crude form
of <tt>call/cc</tt> in C, <tt>setjmp()</tt> and <tt>longjmp()</tt>.
In a sense <tt>setjmp()</tt> saves the current state
of the machine and <tt>longjmp()</tt> carries on from where you left off. But you can't
use <tt>longjmp()</tt> to jump back into a function you've already come from. <tt>longjmp()</tt> can
only unwind the stack and so you must return further up the call chain. This makes
it good for handling exceptions but not for the cool stuff that call/cc can do.
<p>
It <em>is</em> possible to simulate <tt>call/cc</tt>, or something like it, on Unix systems
with system calls like <tt>fork()</tt> that literally duplicate the running process.
<p>
But actually there's a way of doing this in C.
<p>
Rather than implement something exactly like <tt>call/cc</tt> I've implemented one
of the things <em>call/cc</em> is good for: backtracking. In logic programming
languages like Prolog it is possible to reach a point in code execution at which it
is no longer possible to proceed. At this point the interpreter backtracks to a suitable
point and then carries on from where it left off with something changed. This is great for
doing exhaustive searches in combinatorial optimization and theorem proving.
<p>
In the following code I have used a continuation in C to implement non-deterministic
code. Essentially it's a way of setting points to which execution can backtrack
should one avenue of execution fail - like in Prolog. In a way you can think of
C code written with backtracking as <em>declarative</em> rather than <em>imperative</em>.
<p>
First let's look at how the code is used:
<p>

<blockquote>
<table width="75%">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#CCFFFF">
<pre><tt>
/*
 * integer(m,n) returns an integer from m to n inclusive.
 * You can view i = integer(m,n) as the assertion
 * m&lt;=i&lt;=n.
 */
int integer(int m,int n) {
	int i;

	for (i = m; i&lt;=n; ++i) {
		TRY(i);
	}

	FAIL;
}

/*
 * Solve this problem:
 * 2&lt;=i&lt;=100 and
 * 2&lt;=j&lt;=i and
 * i*j==481.
 * In other words factorise 481.
 */
int my_main() {
	int i,j;

	i = integer(2,100);
	j = integer(2,i);

	if (i*j!=481) {
		/*
		 * If they don't factor 481 then
		 * backtrack.
		 */
		FAIL;
	}

	printf("%d %d\n",i,j);
}
</tt></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>

<tt>integer(m,n)</tt> is a function that returns an integer from m to n inclusive. The first time it
returns m using <tt>TRY()</tt>. <tt>TRY()</tt> makes a trial return of its argument. If this
return value causes a <tt>FAIL</tt> later then execution backtracks to this point. In this
case the loop continues and tries m+1 next.
<tt>integer()</tt> is used twice in the code. If the second one fails all the way up to n then it backtracks to
the previous one. In this way it carries out an exhaustive search to factorise 481.
Another way of looking at this is to view <tt>integer()</tt> as a coroutine and <tt>FAIL</tt>
as the command that transfers execution back to the last coroutine that carried out a <tt>TRY()</tt>.

<p>
Here are the implementations of TRY() and FAIL:

	struct cont *next;

void save_stack(cont *c,long *pbos,long *ptos) {
	int n = pbos-ptos;
	int i;

<p>

In order to save a continuation two things need to be grabbed: the state of all
registers and the state of the C stack. <tt>setjmp()</tt> and <tt>longjmp()</tt> provide
a mechanism for saving and restoring the registers. The stack is saved by getting our
hands dirty and simply copying it out. It's extent in memory is found by taking the
address of variables at the top and bottom of the stack. Unfortunately this isn't
100% portable, and is definitely against the rules. But the code above compiles under
Linux, MacOS X, Win32, MSDOS, Irix and probably many other platforms.

Incidentally, if you're trying to implement an interpreter for a language with
continuations in C then one approach is to implement continuations in C. This is
what Aubrey Jaffer did in his Scheme interpreter. If you don't want the stack of
the language you're interpreting to be bound up with the C stack then you can
implement something like Stackless Python <a href="#1">[1]</a>. In fact the example I give above is
similar to the generator example given in [1].
